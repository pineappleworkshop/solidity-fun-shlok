# Instructions

1. Clone Repo
2. Create a solidity development environment
3. Implement a smart contract that:
  - Implements an NFT standard
  - Allows an arbitrary wallet to mint an NFT in exchange for an amount of an ERC20
  - Enforces that the ERC20 can be sent/withdrawn to/from 2 different specific wallets, 50% going to 1 wallet, 50% going to the other wallet
  - Commit code to a branch and open PR to main branch
4. Write a light test for the functionality of the smart contract on an emulated blockchain
5. Deploy and interact with the smart contract on the testnet
6. Write documentation that delivers the functionality of the smart as if another developer is to implement a frontend to consume it

### Extra Credit:

- Implement an upgradeable contract pattern
